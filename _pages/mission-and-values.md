## Mission

We empower organizations seeking to create positive change by listening
carefully to their needs, strategizing collaboratively and delivering
first-class technical solutions.

---

## Core Values

Our team strives to uphold ourselves and one another each day to the following values:

#### Be Inclusive

We embrace diversity in every sense of the word, not only for the benefits it
brings to the company by providing a more holistic perspective on problem solving,
but as it pertains to the empowerment of traditionally and presently
underrepresented groups. We strive to craft an intentionally inclusive work
environment in which everyone feels comfortable in their own skin.

#### Collaborate

Collaboration by means of listening, learning, and teaching is core to our
spirit and key to our success. We share our knowledge and experience in our
daily teamwork and enrich the broader community by imparting our expertise
through [blog posts](/blog/), [public code contributions](https://www.drupal.org/savas),
[hosting local meetups](http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/), and presenting at
conferences.

#### Be Respectful

Respect is paramount to fostering trust with each other and our partners. We
recognize that we are all imperfect human beings and we approach problems with
humility and understanding. With egos checked at the door, our professional
ethos, founded in honesty and integrity, makes us a delight to collaborate with.

#### Empathize

Not only do we find empathy a nice quality to be around, but exercising it intentionally in our work allows us put ourselves in the shoes of our partners and teammates to better understand their successes and struggles which makes us better-informed partners.

#### Excel

We take great care of the people we work with and the quality of the work we produce. By taking a
client-centric approach to solving problems and constantly adding value we
ensure we’re truly understanding each client’s needs and providing thoughtful,
right-fit solutions that adhere to best practices. We hold ourselves to a high
and constantly improving standard.
