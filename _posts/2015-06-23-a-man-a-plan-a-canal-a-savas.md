summary: The truth behind the palindrome.
---

Previously, on our [who we are](/company) page, I gave you a taste of the [meaning](/company#what-does-savas-mean) of Savas. Now let's take a deeper dive.

For those who know me, they _think_ I'm zany. For those who know me well, they **know** I'm zany. For the select few who know me really well, and/or have worked with me, they know I have an odd obsession with [palindromes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

This is why, when we asked [Harbor](http://www.studioharbor.com) to help us
come up with a company identity, including designing our logo and assissting us
with our name selection, "palindrome" was naturally a category of options for
names... e pluribus unum :wink:

## Really though?
While the original impetus for choosing a name that is a palindrome _did_ stem
from previous wholesale high-regard for palindromes, I began to appreciate
the **balance** and **symmetry** that they represent aesthetically, and therefore
thematically for our company.

> It fits really well.

said I.
"Savas" was actually a low-ranking option early on due to our initial, internal feelings on the
connotation as it was presented to us, but after holding a focus group on
top contenders, we discovered people found it alluring, and also tied it to
"savant" and other words that made them think of knowledge from the French word
 _savoir_.

### Fun palindromic facts
- Our area code in Durham, NC is a palindrome: 919
- One of the team's house number is a palindrome: not going to tell you who or what :wink:
- In writing this, I learned a *new* literary term: [Semordnilap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome#Semordnilaps)
which is a word when read backward is a different word! E.g. repaid
- The world's longest palindromic phrase, at least so far _and_ according to [these guys](http://norvig.com/palindrome.html)
is 17,826 words!
