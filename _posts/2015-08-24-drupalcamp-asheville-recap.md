  Drupalcamp Asheville - an all around success!

## Drupalcamp Asheville, we're leaving!
Drupalcamp Asheville was an all around success for Savas Labs. It was our first public camp/conference that we presented at. Anne's presentation on Drupal 8 themeing went swimmingly (and rapidly) to a sold out crowd, and most of my attendees (though as confirmed by one of them after, not all) did _not_ fall asleep covering personal git workflow.

Among the many solid sessions, a highlight was [Ryan Szrama](https://twitter.com/ryanszrama)'s
Offspring music as well as his sharing of a recent foray into the modern PHP
world. We don't have to wait for Drupal 8 to get there.

Outside of the conference doors we got the chance to enjoy other things Asheville
had to offer. We joined the weekly drum circle, and we stumbled upon some
truly excellent food. We indulged in some carrot cake, not to be confused with
raisin cake, at  [plant](http://plantisfood.com/). Joaquin the charmer, served
us a lovely meal at [limones](http://www.limonesrestaurant.com/). We even got to
mix and mingle with the Drupal faithful amongst libations courtesy of
[Andy Giles](https://twitter.com/andyg5000) at the
[Buffalo Nickel](http://www.buffalonickelavl.com/).

After our brains were filled full, we finished up by shutting them off
and going for a hike along the Blue Ridge Parkway.

It was well worth the trip to beautiful Asheville, and it even inspired us to
start to hatch plans for a Drupalcamp Triangle for 2016. Who's coming with us?!
