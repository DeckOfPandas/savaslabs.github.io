Oksana is a right brain / left brain harmonizer that can quickly switch focus from design ideation to code spec all while serving the needs of the end user. As a Designer & Developer at Savas Labs, Oksana grounds her work in analytic research swiftly composing balanced solutions that fulfill high-level organizational goals.

She began building her digital marketing skill set in 2007 as she worked towards her Masterâ€™s Degree in Applied Mathematics and Informatics. Having lived and worked in both hemispheres, Oksana has refined a unique vision and discipline while working with diverse cultures within various industries. She is committed to delivering robust systems that are intuitive for the humans that use them.

Oksana prefers to take the path less travelled, usually with a 2 ft. long camera lens strapped around her shoulder. She enjoys travel via back-country roads where she can provoke a more genuine learning experience of American history and culture.
