summary: |
  Maintenance work doesn't typically evoke dreamy visions like building a new application does. However, we recognize the original investment is only truly borne when it's in reliable operation. With the help of generous robots (who we pay), and partners, we ensure 24/7/365 support.

A site with an audience that is engaged on a daily basis requires the same technical attention behind the scenes. We provide just that. Our robot friends ensure that our clients' sites are alive and well with robust monitoring. Our humans quickly test and apply security updates and make recommendations on sustainability best practices. A support & maintenance agreement will often start with an audit.
